# BUG-005: Declaration falsely flagged as substantive

**Severity:** Minor
**Status:** Fixed
**Found in:** QA Pre-testing — live scrape of `professor-stephen-mcdonnell`
**Spec reference:** Quick Spec §3.2 `declaration_substantive` field; R6 §16.3 finding #3
**Date:** 2026-02-28

## Description

`isDeclarationSubstantive` returns true for Nuffield's standard "does not hold" / "does not have" boilerplate phrasing, incorrectly flagging the declaration as containing real financial interests.

## Root Cause

`DECLARATION_BOILERPLATE_PATTERNS` was missing Nuffield-specific negative phrasing variants. Also no aggregate check — if ALL sentences match known boilerplate patterns, the whole declaration should be non-substantive.

## Fix

- Added boilerplate patterns: `does not hold a share`, `does not have a financial`, `does not hold a financial interest`, `no share or financial interest`
- Added aggregate check: if ALL sentences match known patterns, return false (non-substantive)

## Regression Tests

- `parse.test.ts`: "identifies 'does not hold' Nuffield phrasing as non-substantive"
- `parse.test.ts`: "identifies multi-sentence all-boilerplate as non-substantive"

## Files Changed

- `src/scraper/parse.ts` — `DECLARATION_BOILERPLATE_PATTERNS`, `isDeclarationSubstantive`
