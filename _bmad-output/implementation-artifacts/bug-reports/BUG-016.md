# BUG-016: Hospital name captures form CTA text on profiles with no location section

**Severity:** Medium
**Found by:** QA spot-check team (Agent 3, batch 3)
**Affected profile:** `mr-hassan-mohammed` (and any profile with no hospital assignment)
**Spec reference:** §3.1 `hospital_name_primary`, §4.2 parser strategy

## Symptom

`hospital_name_primary` contains form CTA text:
```
"Ask a question about this consultant\n              \n\n              \n                \n                  \n                  Fill in the form below and we'll get back to you within two working days."
```

Expected value: `null` (profile has no hospital assignment).

## Root Cause

`extractHospitalInfo()` in `parse.ts` has a two-stage extraction:

1. **Primary (correct):** Looks for H3 inside the classified LOCATIONS section — works fine, returns nothing when no location section exists.
2. **Fallback (buggy):** Uses CSS selector `[class*='hospital']` which is overly broad. On profiles with no location section, it matches `<div class="contact-us__intro contact-us__intro--hospitals">` — the "Ask a question" contact form container.

Fallback selector matches on this profile:
- `div.contact-us__intro--hospitals` → form CTA text (BUG)
- `span.radiology-hospital-name` → empty
- `span.cancellation-hospital-name` → empty
- `a.cancellation-hospital-number` → empty

## Fix

Remove the overly broad `[class*='hospital']` from the fallback selector. Keep only the specific class selectors (`.consultant__hospital`, `.hospital-name`) which target actual hospital display elements. These return nothing on profiles with no hospital, so `hospital_name_primary` correctly becomes `null`.

## Impact

- Affects profiles with no hospital/location section (rare — only 1 found in 200-profile sample)
- Cascading effects: `hospital_code_primary` also null, `hospital_is_nuffield` defaults to true (correct fallback per BUG-010 fix)
- `specialty_primary` and `registration_number` were also empty on this profile — separate issue (the profile genuinely lacks these fields on the live page)

## Verification

- Re-scrape `mr-hassan-mohammed` after fix
- Confirm `hospital_name_primary` is `null`
- Confirm no other fields affected
- Run full test suite
