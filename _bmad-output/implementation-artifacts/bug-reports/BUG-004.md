# BUG-004: practising_since null despite year present in Qualifications

**Severity:** Moderate
**Status:** Fixed
**Found in:** QA Pre-testing — live scrape of `professor-stephen-mcdonnell`
**Spec reference:** Quick Spec §4.2 "Practising since" heading variants; §3.2 `practising_since` field
**Date:** 2026-02-28

## Description

`extractPractisingYearFromSections` returns null even though the profile contains "Practising since: 2001" as a paragraph inside the Qualifications section.

## Root Cause

The function only checks for headings classified as PRACTISING_SINCE. When the practising year appears as a `<p>` element inside another section (e.g. Qualifications), no heading gets classified and the function returns null.

The quick spec documents two patterns: year embedded in heading text, and year as a separate inline element. This is a third pattern — year in a paragraph inside a different section — that the spec didn't anticipate.

## Fix

After heading search fails, scan all `<p>` elements in QUALIFICATIONS and RELATED_EXPERIENCE sections for "practising since" text with year regex.

## Regression Tests

- `parse.test.ts`: "extracts practising year from paragraph inside Qualifications section"

## Files Changed

- `src/scraper/parse.ts` — `extractPractisingYearFromSections`
